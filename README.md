## Fabrication
For the formation of the MoS2 nano layer, sonication process is performed using the probe sonicator followed by centrifugation process.
 #### Chemicals
- Molybdenum Disulfide (MOS2) – 120 mg	
- Ammonia aqua solution (NH3) – 40 ml (50% v/v)

#### Sonication Specification
- **Appratus** - Probe sonicator
- **Pulse-ON time** – 5 seconds
- **Pulse-OFF time** – 2 seconds
- **Probe size** – 16 mm
- **Power rate** – 20%
- **Total run time** – 2 hrs 45 min
#### Centrifugation Specification
- **Appratus** - Centrifuge
- **Total Run Time** - 15min
- **Rotational Speed** - 4500rpm

For the formation of MoS2 nano layer over the Si substrate, **Spin Coating** process is used. Few drops of single layer MoS2 sample is placed over the SiO2 wafer(thickenss of SiO2 layer is 180nm) followed high speed rotation of the wafer. The process is followed by the heating process using the hot plate.  The resultant will be a mono layer MOS2 over the wafer. The process(i.e. spin coating followed by the heating) is followed several times to the layers as per the requirments.

*Hot Plate temperature is set at 60  ̊C.*

 


## Characterization
On the fabricated result we have performed following Characterization

- Crystallization Characterization
- Optical Characterization
- Surface Characterization
- Electrical Characterization
For different characterization, different process is performed over the formed substrate. in some processes, it is deposited over a substrate like in Crystallization process and in some process  directly on the substrate.


**Characterization** | **Process Equipment** |
--- | --- | 
Crystallization Characterization | X-Ray Diffraction(XRD) |
Optical Characterization | UV-Visible Spectroscope | 
Surface Characterization | FESEM | 
Electrical Characterization | Gas Sensor(SAI India) |

Electrical Characterization is performed once the complete fabrication process is completed using the gas sensor probe station to get IvsV properties of the wafer. Since it is a gas sensing device, Electrical Characterization is performed in presence of gas and in vacuum(to get base line) to get the response and recovery  time of device. Apart from this, current vs Time is also plotted with the help of Probe Station.
